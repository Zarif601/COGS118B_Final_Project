Heart disease is one of the deadliest diseases in the United States, affecting most men, women and people of most racial and ethnic groups. Statistically, a person in the United States dies every 36 seconds from a type of heart disease, which totals up to around 655,000 Americans. (”Heart Disease Facts”, 2020) With the prevalence of heart disease, we decided to conduct an analysis to see which factors contribute to the disease. This is important as identifying contributing factors could improve preventive care and cut medical cost. We are trying to predict the severity of a heart disease through the accumulated vital organ information. We choose to cluster the data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as K-means and reduce dimensionality of the data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We will analyze the accuracy of the K-Means model before and after dimensionality reduction. We decided to use K-Means as it guarantees convergence, it adapts to new samples, is simple to implement, and generalizes the cluster shapes. We used
PCA to perform feature selection in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data. This is helpful when dealing with features that have multicollinearity and projects all
data points into a lower-dimensional subspace.
